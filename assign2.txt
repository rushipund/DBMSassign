4) Why isnâ€™t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
   * In RDBMS, Table is not a file every row is a file.
   * Rows of a table is not stored sequentially.
   * Rows of a table Scattered.
   * When you insert into table wherever the system finds free space
     in DataBase Hardisk it will store the row there.
   * When you update a row if the row lengh is increasing then the 
     entire row may be moved to some other address.
   * Later when you select from the table you will find the entire 
     row at some other position.(only in case of Varchar)
   * Hence it is not possible to see first or last 'N' rows of table.
