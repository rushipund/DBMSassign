1) Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as all combinations of
cnum and snum are different from one another, and so that NULL values are
excluded from the date field.
ANS->  create table orders2(cnum int,snum int,odate date not null,primary key(cnum,snum));




2) Create the Salespeople table so that the default commission is 10% with no
NULLS permitted, snum is the primary key, and all names fall alphabetically
between A and M, inclusive (assume all names will be uppercase).
ANS-> create table sales_people2(snum int primary key,sname varchar(10) check(substr(upper(sname),1,1) between 'A' and 'M'),comm float(7,2)default 10);


3) Create the Orders table, making sure that the onum is greater than the cnum, and
the cnum is greater that the snum. Allow no NULLS in any of these three fields

ANS->create table orders3 (cnum int(10),onum int(10),snum int(10),check(onum>cnum and cnum>snum));
