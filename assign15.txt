1) Assume there is a table called Multicust, with all of the same column definitions
as Salespeople. Write a command that inserts all salespeople with more than one
customer into this table.
ANS->

create table multicast as select * from sales_people where snum=any(select customers.snum from customers,sales_people where customers.snum=sales_people.snum group by customers.snum having count(customers.snum)>1);


 OR

create table Multicast as select * from salespeople where snum in
    (select snum from customers group by snum having count(snum) >1);


2) Write a command that deletes all customers with no current orders.

ANS->delete from customers where cnum=any(select customers.cnum from customers where customers.cnum!=all(select customers.cnum from customers,orders where customers.cnum=orders.cnum));

OR

delete from  customers where cnum not in (select cnum from orders);



3) Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all
salespeople with total orders above Rs. 3,000.

ANS-> update sales_people set comm=comm+(comm*(20/100)) where snum in(select snum from orders group by snum having sum(amt)>3000);
